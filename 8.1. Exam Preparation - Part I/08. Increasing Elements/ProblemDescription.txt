https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/simple-loops-problems/simple-loops-problems/problem-increasing-elements.html

A series of n numbers is given: a1, a2, …, an. Calculate the length of the longest increasing sequence of consecutive elements in the series of numbers.

Input
The input data is read from the console. The first line holds an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000). 
On the following n lines we are given n integers in the range [-1000 … 1000]: a1, a2, …, an.

Output
On the console we must print one number – the length of the longest increasing sequence.
