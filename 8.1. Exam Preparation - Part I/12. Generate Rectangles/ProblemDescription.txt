12. Generate Rectangles 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/nested-loops-problems/nested-loops-problems/problem-generating-rectangles.html

By a given number n and a minimum area m, generate all possible rectangles with integer coordinates in the range [-n…n] with an area of at least m. The generated rectangles must be printed in the following format:

(left, top) (right, bottom) -> area
Rectangles are defined using the top left and bottom right corner. The following inequalities are in effect:

-n ≤ left < right ≤ n
-n ≤ top < bottom ≤ n
Input
Two numbers, one per line, are entered from the console:

An integer n in the range [1 … 100] – sets the minimum and maximum coordinates of a peak.
An integer m in the range [0 … 50 000] – sets the minimum area of the generated rectangles.

Output
The described rectangles should be printed on the console in a format such as in the examples below.
If there are no rectangles for the specified n and m, then print "No".
The order of rectangles in the output is not important, so use and order of your choice.

Input	  Output	
1
2	    (-1, -1) (0, 1) -> 2
      (-1, -1) (1, 0) -> 2
      (-1, -1) (1, 1) -> 4
      (-1, 0) (1, 1) -> 2
      (0, -1) (1, 1) -> 2	

2
17	  No

3
36	  (-3, -3) (3, 3) -> 36
