https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/complex-conditions-problems/complex-conditions-problems/problem-date-after-5-days.html

There are two numbers d (day) and m (month) that form a date.
Write a program that prints the date that will be 5 days a particular date. For example, 5 days after 28.03 is the date 2.04. 
We assume that the months: April, June, September and November have 30 days, February has 28 days, and the rest have 31 days.
Months to be printed with leading zero when they contain a single digit (e.g. 01, 08).

Input
The input is read from the console and consists of two lines:

On the first line we read an integer d in the range [1 … 31] – day. 
The number of the day does not exceed the number of days in that month (e.g. 28 for February).
On the second line we read an integer m in the range [1 … 12] – month. Month 1 is January, month 2 is February, …, month 12 is December.
The month may contain a leading zero (e.g. April may be written as 4 or 04).

Output
Print a single line containing the date after 5 days in the format day.month on the console. The month must be a 2-digit number with a leading zero, if necessary. The day must be written without leading zero.
