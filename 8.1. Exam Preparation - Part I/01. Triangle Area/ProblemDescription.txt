01. Triangle Area 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/simple-calculations-problems/simple-calc-problems/problem-triangle-area.html

Triangle in the plane is defined by the coordinates of its three vertices. First the vertex (x1, y1) is set.
Then the other two vertices are set: (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), which lie on a common horizontal line (i.e. they have the same Y coordinates). Write a program that calculates the area of the triangle by the coordinates of its three vertices.	

Input
The console reads 6 integers (one per line): x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3.

All input numbers are in range [-1000 â€¦ 1000].
It is guaranteed that y2 = y3.
Output
Print on the console the area of the triangle.
