03. Point on Segment 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/simple-conditions-problems/simple-conditions-problems/problem-point-on-a-segment.html

A horizontal segment is placed on a horizontal line, set with the x coordinates of both ends: first and second. 
A point is located on the same horizontal line and is set with its x coordinate. 
Write a program that checks whether the point is inside or outside the segment and calculates the distance to the nearest end of the segment.

Input
The console reads 3 integer numbers (one per line):

On the first line the number "first" is read – one end of the segment.
On the second line the number "second" is read – the other end of the segment.
On the third line the number "point" is read – the location of the point.
All input numbers are integers in the range [-1000 … 1000].

Output
Print the result on the console:

On the first line, print "in" or "out" – whether the point is inside or outside the segment.
On the second line, print the distance from the point to the nearest end of the segment.
