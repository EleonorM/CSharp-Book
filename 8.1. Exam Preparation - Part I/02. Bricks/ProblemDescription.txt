Construction workers have to transfer a total of x bricks. Workers are w and work simultaneously.
They transport the bricks in trolleys, each with a capacity of m bricks.
Write a program that reads the integers x, w, and m, and calculates what is the minimum number of courses the workers need to do to transport the bricks.

Input
On the console 3 integers are given, one per line:

The number of bricks x is read from the first line.
The number of workers w is read from the second line
The capacity of the trolley m is read from the third line.
All input numbers are integers in the range [1 â€¦ 1000].

Output
Print on the console the minimum number of courses needed to transport the bricks.
