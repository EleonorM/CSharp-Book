https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/complex-conditions-problems/complex-conditions-problems/problem-sums-of-3-numbers.html

There are 3 integers given. Write a program that checks if the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third one.
For example, if the numbers are 3, 5 and 2, the sum of two of the numbers is equal to the third one: 2 + 3 = 5.

Input
The console reads three integers, one per line. The numbers are in the range [1 … 1000].

Output
Print a text line on the console containing the solution of the problem in the format "a + b = c", where a, b and c are among the three input numbers and a ≤ b.
If the problem has no solution, print "No" on the console.
