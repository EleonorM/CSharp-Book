07. Sums Step 3 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/simple-loops-problems/simple-loops-problems/problem-sums-with-step-of-3.html

We are given n integers: a1, a2, …, an. Calculate the sums:

sum1 = a1 + a4 + a7 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the first one with step of 3).
sum2 = a2 + a5 + a8 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the second one with step of 3).
sum3 = a3 + a6 + a9 + … (the numbers are summed, starting from the third one with step of 3).
Input
The input data is read from the console. The first line holds an integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
On the next n lines we are given n integers in the range [-1000 … 1000]: a1, a2, …, an.

Output
On the console we should print 3 lines containing the 3 sums in a format such as in the example.
