ChangeTiles


The tiles on the ground in front of an apartment building need changing. 
The ground has a square shape with side of N meters.
The tiles are "W" meters wide and "L" meters long. 
There is one bench on the ground with width of "M" meters and length of "O" meters. 
The tiles under it do not need to be replaced. Each tile is replaced for 0.2 minutes.

Write a program that reads the size of the ground, the tiles and the bench from the console, and calculates how many tiles are needed to cover the ground and what is the total time for replacing the tiles.

Example: ground with size 20 mm has area of 400 m^2m.
A bench that is 1 mm wide and 2 mm long, has area of 2 m^2m.
One tile is 5 mm wide and 4 mm long and has area of 20 m^2m.
The space that needs to be covered is 400 - 2 = 398 m^2m.
Therefore, 398 / 20 = 19.90 tiles are necessary. The time needed is 19.90 * 0.2 = 3.98 minutes.

Input Data
The input data comes as 5 numbers, which are read from the console:

N – length of a side of the ground within the range of [1 … 100].
W – width per tile within the range of [0.1 … 10.00].
L – length per tile within the range of [0.1 … 10.00].
М – width of the bench within the range of [0 … 10].
О – length of the bench within the range of [0 … 10].
Output Data
Print on the console two numbers: number of tiles needed for the repair and the total time for changing them, each on a new line.
