It is strange, but most people start planning their vacations well in advance.
A young programmer from Bulgaria has certain budget and spare time in a particular season.

Write a program that accepts as input the budget (in BGN – Bulgarian levs) and season, and as output displays programmer's vacation place and the amount of money they will spend.

The budget determines the destination, and the season determines what amount of the budget will be spent.
If the season is summer, the programmer will go camping, if it is winter – they will stay in a hotel.
If it is in Europe, regardless of the season, the programmer will stay in a hotel.
Each camp or hotel, according to the destination, has its own price, which corresponds to a particular percentage of the budget:

If 100 BGN or less – somewhere in Bulgaria.
Summer – 30% of the budget.
Winter – 70% of the budget.
If 1000 BGN or less – somewhere on the Balkans.
Summer – 40% of the budget.
Winter – 80% of the budget.
If more than 1000 BGN – somewhere in Europe.
Upon traveling in Europe, regardless of the season, the programmer will spend 90% of the budget.

Input Data
The input data will be read from the console and will consist of two lines:

The first line holds the budget – real number in the range [10.00 … 5000.00].
The second line holds one of two possible seasons: "summer" or "winter".
Output Data
Two lines must be printed on the console.

On the first line – "Somewhere in {destination}" among "Bulgaria", "Balkans" and "Europe".
On the second line – "{Vacation type} – {Amount spent}".
The Vacation can be in a "Camp" or "Hotel".
The Amount must be rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point.
