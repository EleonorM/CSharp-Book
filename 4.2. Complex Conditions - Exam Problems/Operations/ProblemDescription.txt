03. Operations 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-4-2-complex-conditions-exam-problems/exam-problems/operations/operations.html

Write a program that reads two integers (n1 and n2) and an operator that performs a particular mathematical operation with them. 
Possible operations are: summing up (+), subtraction (-), multiplying (*), division (/) and modular division (%).
Upon summing up, subtracting and multiplying, the console must print the result and display whether it is even or odd number. 
Upon regular division – just the result, and upon modular division – the remainder. 
You need to take into consideration the fact that the divisor can be equal to zero (= 0) and dividing by zero is not possible. 
In this case, a special notification must be printed.

Input Data
3 lines are read from the console:

N1 – integer within the range [0 … 40 000].
N2 – integer within the range [0 … 40 000].
Operator – one character among: "+", "-", "*", "/", "%".

Output Data
Print the output as a single line on the console:

If the operation is summing up, subtraction or multiplying:
"{N1} {operator} {N2} = {output} – {even/odd}".
If the operation is division:
"{N1} / {N2} = {output}" – the result is formatted up to the second digit after the decimal point.
If the operation is modular division:
"{N1} % {N2} = {remainder}".
In case of dividing by 0 (zero):
"Cannot divide {N1} by zero".

Input	    Output	
123
12
/	        123 / 12 = 10.25	

112
0
/	        Cannot divide 112 by zero

10
3
%	        10 % 3 = 1	

10
0
%	        Cannot divide 10 by zero

10
12
+	        10 + 12 = 22 - even

10
1
-	        10 - 1 = 9 - odd

7
3
*	        7 * 3 = 21 - odd
