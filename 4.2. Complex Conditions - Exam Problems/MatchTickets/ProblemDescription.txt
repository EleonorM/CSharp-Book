https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-4-2-complex-conditions-exam-problems/exam-problems/match-tickets/match-tickets.html

A group of football fans decided to buy tickets for Euro Cup 2016. The tickets are sold in Bulgarian leva (BGN) in two price categories:

VIP – 499.99 BGN (Bulgarian leva)
Normal – 249.99 BGN (Bulgarian leva)
The football fans have a shared budget, and the number of people in the group determines what percentage of the budget will be spent on transportation:

1 to 4 – 75% of the budget
5 to 9 – 60% of the budget
10 to 24 – 50% of the budget
25 to 49 – 40% of the budget
50 or more – 25% of the budget
Write a program that calculates whether the money left in the budget will be enough for the football fans to buy tickets in the selected category, as well as how much money they will have left or be insufficient.

Input Data
The input data is read from the console and contains exactly 3 lines:

The first line contains the budget – real number within the range [1 000.00 … 1 000 000.00].
The second line contains the category – "VIP" or "Normal".
The third line contains the number of people in the group – an integer within the range [1 … 200].

Output Data
Print the following on the console as one line:

If the budget is sufficient:
"Yes! You have {N} leva left." – where N is the amount of remaining money for the group.
If the budget is NOT sufficient:
"Not enough money! You need {М} leva." – where М is the amount that is insufficient.
The amounts must be formatted up to the second digit after the decimal point.


Input	      Output	                                Explanations
1000
Normal
1	        Yes! You have 0.01 leva left.	            1 person: 75% of the budget are spent on transportation.
                                                    Remaining amount: 1000 – 750 = 250.
                                                    Category Normal: the ticket price is 249.99 * 1 = 249.99
                                                    249.99 < 250: the person will have 250 - 249.99 = 0.01 money left

30000
VIP
49	      Not enough money! You need 6499.51 leva.	49 persons: 40% of the budget are spent on transportation.
                                                    Remaining amount: 30000 - 12000 = 18000.
                                                    Category VIP: the ticket costs 499.99 * 49.
                                                    24499.51 < 18000: the amount is not enough, more money needed: 24499.51 - 18000 = 6499.51
