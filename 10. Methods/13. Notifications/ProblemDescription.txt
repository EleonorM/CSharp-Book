13. Notifications 


Write a program, which takes an integer n and n input messages and prints n output messages, based on the input. 
For each message read a few lines. Each message starts with messageType: “success”, “warning” or “error”:

When messageType is “success” read operation + message (each from a new line).
When messageType is “warning” read only message (from a new line).
When messageType is “error” read operation + message + errorCode (each from a new line).
Print on the console each read message, formatted depending on its messageType. 
After the headline of the message print as much =, as the length of the said headline and print an empty line after each message (to understand in detail look at the examples).

The problem should be solved by defining four methods: ShowSuccessMessage(), ShowWarningMessage(), ShowErrorMessage() and ReadAndProcessMessage(), so that only the last method is invoked by the Main() method:

Input	        
4
error
credit card purchase
Invalid customer address
500
warning

success
user registration
User registered successfully
