01. Distance 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-8-2-exam-preparation-part-2/distance/distance.html

Write a program that calculates what is the distance passed by a car (in kilometers), if we know the initial speed (km/h), the initial time frame in minutes, then the speed is increased by 10%, the second time frame, then the speed is decreased by 5%, and the time until the end of the trip. 
In order to calculate the distance, you need to convert the minutes into hours (for example 70 minutes = 1.1666 hours).

Input Data
4 lines are read from the console:

The initial speed in km/h – an integer within the range [1 … 300].
The first time frame in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].
The second time frame in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].
The third time frame in minutes – an integer within the range [1 … 1000].

Output Data
Print a number on the console: the kilometers passed, formatted up to the second symbol after the decimal point.

80	    330.90	    Distance with initial speed: 90 km/h * 1 hr (60 min) = 90 km
                    After speed increase: 90 + 10% = 99.00 km/h * 1.166 hr (70 min) = 115.50 km
                    After speed decrease: 99 - 5% = 94.05 km/h * 1.33 hr (80 min) = 125.40 km
                    Total number of km passed: 330.9 km

190	    917.12	    Distance with initial speed: 140 km/h * 1.86 hr (112 min) = 261.33 km
                    After speed increase: 140 + 10% = 154.00 km/h * 1.25 hr (75 min) = 192.5 km
                    After speed decrease: 154.00 - 5% = 146.29 km/h * 3.16 hr (190 min) = 463.28 km
                    Total number of km passed: 917.1166 km
