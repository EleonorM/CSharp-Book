02. Change Tiles 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-8-2-exam-preparation-part-2/change-tiles/change-tiles.html

Harry has some savings that he wants to use to change the tiles on the bathroom floor. The floor is rectangular, and the tiles are triangular. Write a program that calculates if his savings will be sufficient. Read from the console the width and length of the floor, as well as one of the sides of the triangle with its height towards it. We must calculate how many tiles are needed, in order to cover the floor. The number of tiles must be rounded up to the higher integer and 5 more tiles must be added as spare tiles. Also read from the console – the price per tile and the amount paid for the work of a workman. All prices and money calculations are performed in lv (Bulgarian levs, BGN).

Input Data
The following 7 lines must be read from the console:

Savings.
Floor width.
Floor length.
Side of the rectangle.
Height of the rectangle.
Price of a tile in lv (Bulgarian levs, BGN).
Fee to be paid to the workman.
All numbers must be real numbers within the range [0.00 … 5000.00].

Output Data
The following must be printed on the console as a single line:

If the money is sufficient:
“{Remaining funds} lv left.”
If the money IS NOT sufficient:
“You'll need {Insufficient funds} lv more.”
The result must be formatted up to the second symbol after the decimal point.

100	    25.60 lv left.	            Floor area → 3 * 2.5 = 7.5
                                    Tile area → 0.5 * 0.7 / 2 = 0.175
                                    Needed tiles → 7.5 / 0.175 = 42.857… = 43 + 5 spare tiles = 48
                                    Total amount → 48 * 7.8 + 100 (workman) = 474.4
                                    474.4 < 500 → 25.60 lv left

321	  You'll need 1209.65 lv more.	Floor area → 5.55 * 8.95 = 49.67249
                                    Tile area → 0.9 * 0.85 / 2 = 0.3825
                                    Needed tiles → 49.67249 / 0.3825 = 129.86… = 130 + 5 spare tiles = 135
                                    Total amount → 135 * 13.99 + 321 (workman) = 2209.65
                                    2209.65 > 1000 → 1209.65 lv are insufficient
