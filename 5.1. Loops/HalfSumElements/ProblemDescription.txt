10. Half Sum Element 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-5-1-loops/exercises-loops/half-sum-element.html

Write a program that inputs n integers and checks whether among them there is a number equal to the sum of all the rest.
If there is such an element, print "Yes" + its value, otherwise â€“ "No" + the difference between the largest element and the sum of the rest (by absolute value).
