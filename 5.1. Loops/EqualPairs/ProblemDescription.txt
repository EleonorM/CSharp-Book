12. Equal Pairs 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-5-1-loops/exercises-loops/equal-pairs.html

There are 2 * n numbers. The first and the second number form a pair, the third and the fourth number also, and so on.
Each pair has a value – the sum of its numbers. Write a program that checks if all pairs have equal value.

In case the value is the same, print "Yes, value=…" + the value, otherwise, print the maximum difference between two neighboring pairs in the following format: "No, maxdiff=…" + the maximum difference.

The input consists of the number n, followed by 2*n integers, all of them one per line.
