https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-5-1-loops/examples-for-loops/example-left-and-right-sum/example-left-and-right-sum.html

Write a program that converts 2 * n integers and checks whether the sum of the first n integers (left sum) equals the sum of the second n numbers (right sum). In case the sums are equal, print "Yes" + the sum, otherwise print "No" + the difference. The difference is calculated as a positive number (by absolute value). The format of the output must be identical to the one in the examples below.


Input	    Output	
2
10
90
60
40	      Yes, sum = 100	

2
90
9
50
50	      No, diff = 1
