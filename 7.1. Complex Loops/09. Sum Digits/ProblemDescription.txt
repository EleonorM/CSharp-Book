09. Sum Digits

We can use the following idea to solve the problem: extract many times the last digit from the input number and sum the extracted digits until the input number reaches 0. 
Example:

sum = 0
n = 5634 ðŸ¡’ extract 4; sum += 4; n = 563
n = 563 ðŸ¡’ extract 3; sum += 3; n = 56
n = 56 ðŸ¡’ extract 6; sum += 6; n = 5
n = 5 ðŸ¡’ extract 5; sum += 5; n = 0 ðŸ¡’ end
In more detail the above idea looks like this:

We create the variable n, to which we assign a value equal to the number entered by the user.
We create a second variable â€“ sum, which initial value is 0. We will use it for the calculation and storage of the result.
As a loop condition, we will use n > 0 because after each calculation of the result in the body of the loop, we will remove the last digit of n.
In the body of the loop:
We assign a new value of sum that is the result of the sum of the current value of sum with the last digit of n.
We assign a new value to n, which is the result of removing the last digit of n.
Outside the body of the loop, we print the final value of the sum.
