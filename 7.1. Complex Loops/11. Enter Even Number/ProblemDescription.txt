11. Enter Even Number 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-7-1-complex-loops/infinite-loops/infinite-loops/example-enter-an-even-number.html

The next example will be to write a program that enters an even number from the console. If an odd number is entered, the program should enter a number again, until an even number is entered.

We shall use an infinite loop with break to solve this problem, because we don't know how many times the loop body will be repeated.

We shall check if a particular number n is even, and if it is, we will print it on the screen. 
An even number is one that can be divided by 2 without remainder. 
If an invalid number is entered, we will ask the user to enter a number again and will display a notification that the input number is not even.
