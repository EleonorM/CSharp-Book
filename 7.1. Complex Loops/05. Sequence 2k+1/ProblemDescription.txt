Write a program that prints all numbers ≤ n of the series: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, …, assuming that each next number = previous number * 2 + 1.

Here is how we can solve the problem:

We create a num variable for the current number to which we assign an initial value of 1.
For a loop condition, we put the current number <= n.
In the body of the loop: we print the value of the current number and increase the current number by using the formula from the problem's description.
