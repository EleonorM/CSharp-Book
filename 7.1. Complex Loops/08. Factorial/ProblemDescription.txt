08. Factorial

For natural n number, calculate n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * … * n. For example, if n = 5, the result will be: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.

Here is how we can specifically calculate factorial:

We create the variable n to which we assign an integer value taken from the console input.
We create another variable – a fact which initial value is 1. We will use it for the calculation and storage of the factorial.
For a loop condition, we will use n > 1, because each time we perform the calculations in the body of the loop, we will decrease the value of n by 1.
In the body of the loop:
We assign a new value to fact that is the result of multiplying the current fact value to the current value of n.
We decrease the value of n by -1.
Outside the body of the loop, we print the final factorial value.
