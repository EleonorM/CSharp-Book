Before proceeding to the next problem, we will get familiar with the definition of the greatest common divisor (GCD), widely used in mathematics and numbers theory, and will learn how to calculate GCD.

Definition of GCD: the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers a and b is the largest number that divides both a and b without reminder.

a	        b	        GCD
24	      16	      8
67	      18	      1
12	      24	      12
15	      9	        3   
10	      10	      10
100	      88	      4
