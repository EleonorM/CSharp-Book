Write a program that checks if an n number is even, and if it is, prints it on the screen. 
If an invalid number is entered, the program should display a notification that the entered input is not a valid number and the entering of the number has to be done again.

Here's how we can solve the problem:

We create an infinite while loop and as a condition we set true.
In the body of the loop:
We create a try-catch construction.
In the try block we write the programming logic for reading the user input, parsing it to a number, and the check for even number.
If it is an even number, we print it and go out of the loop (with break). The program is done and ends.
If it is an odd number, we print a message saying that an even number is required without leaving the loop (because we want it to be repeated again).
If we catch an exception when executing the try block, we write a message for invalid input number (and the loop is repeated because we do not explicitly go out of it).
