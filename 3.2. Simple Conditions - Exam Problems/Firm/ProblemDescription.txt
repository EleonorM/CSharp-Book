05. Firm 

A firm gets a request for creating a project for which a certain number of hours are needed. 
The firm has a certain number of days. 
During 10% of the days, the workers are being trained and cannot work on the project. 
A normal working day is 8 hours long.
The project is important for the firm and every worker must work on it with overtime of 2 hours per day.

The hours must be rounded down to the nearest integer (for example, 6.98 hours are rounded to 6 hours).

Write a program that calculates whether the firm can finish the project on time and how many hours more are needed or left.

Input Data
The input data is read from the console and contains exactly three lines:

On the first line are the needed hours – an integer in the range of [0 … 200 000].
On the second line are the days that the firm has – an integer in the range of [0 … 20 000].
On the third line are the number of all workers – an integer in the range of [0 … 200].

Output Data
Print one line on the console:

If the time is enough:
"Yes!{the hours left} hours left.".
If the time is NOT enough:
"Not enough time!{additional hours} hours needed.".
