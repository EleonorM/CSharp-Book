https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-3-2-simple-conditions-exam-problems/exam-problems/sleepy-tom-cat/sleepy-tom-cat.html

Tom Cat likes to sleep all day but, unfortunately, his owner is always playing with him whenever he has free time. 
In order to sleep well, the norm of games that Tom has is 30 000 minutes per year. 
The time for games he has depends on the holidays that his owner has:

During work days, his owner plays with him 63 minutes per day.
During holidays, his owner plays with him 127 minutes per day.
Write a program that reads the number of holidays and prints whether Tom can sleep well and how much the difference from the norm for the current year is. 
It is assumed that there are 365 days in one year.

Example: 20 holidays -> the working days are 345 (365 - 20 = 345). The time for games is 24 275 minutes (345 * 63 + 20 * 127).
The difference from the norm is 5 725 minutes (30 000 – 24 275 = 5 725) or 95 hours and 25 minutes.

Input Data
The input is read from the console and consists of an integer – the number of holidays in the range of [0 … 365].

Output Data
Two lines have to be printed on the console:

If Tom's time for games is above the norm for the current year:
On the first line print: “Tom will run away”
On the second line print the difference from the norm in the format:
“{H} hours and {M} minutes more for play”
If the time for games of Tom is below the norm for the current year:
On the first line print: “Tom sleeps well”
On the second line print the difference from the norm in the format:
“{H} hours and {M} minutes less for play”

20	      Tom sleeps well
          95 hours and 25 minutes less for play	
          
113	      Tom will run away
          3 hours and 47 minutes for play
