https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-3-2-simple-conditions-exam-problems/exam-problems/harvest/harvest.html
In a vineyard with area X square meters, 40% of the harvest goes for wine production.
Y kilograms of grapes are extracted from 1 m^2m vineyard.
2,5 kg of grapes are needed for 1 liter of wine. The wanted quantity of wine for sale is Z liters.

Write a program that calculates how much wine can be produced and whether that quantity is enough.
If it is enough, the rest is divided between the vineyard workers equally.

Input Data
The input data is read from the console and consists of exactly 4 lines:

First line: X m^2m – the vineyard size – an integer in the range of [10 … 5000].
Second line: Y grapes for one m^2m – an integer in the range of [0.00 … 10.00].
Third line: Z needed liters of wine – an integer in the range of [10 … 600].
Fourth line: number of workers – an integer in the range of [1 … 20].
Output Data
The following has to be printed on the console:

If the produced wine is less than the needed quantity:
“It will be a tough winter! More {insufficient wine} liters wine needed.”
* The result has to be rounded down to the nearest integer.
If the produced wine is more than the needed quantity:
“Good harvest this year! Total wine: {total wine} liters.”
* The result has to be rounded down to the nearest integer.
“{Wine left} liters left -> {wine for one worker} liters per person.”
* Both of the results have to be rounded up to the higher integer.
