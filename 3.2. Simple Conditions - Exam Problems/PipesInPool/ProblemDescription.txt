02. Pipes In Pool
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-3-2-simple-conditions-exam-problems/exam-problems/pipes-in-pool/pipes-in-pool.html

A pool with volume V fills up via two pipes. 
Each pipe has a certain flow rate (the liters of water, flowing through a pipe for an hour).
A worker starts the pipes simultaneously and goes out for N hours. 
Write a program that finds the state of the pool the moment the worker comes back.

Input Data
Four lines are read from the console:

The first line contains a number V – the volume of the pool in liters – an integer in the range of [1 … 10000].
The second line contains a number P1 – the flow rate of the first pipe per hour – an integer in the range of [1 … 5000].
The third line contains a number P2 – the flow rate of the second pipe per hour – an integer in the range of [1 … 5000].
The fourth line contains a number H – the hours that the worker is absent – a floating-point number in the range of [1.0 … 24.00].
Output Data
Print on the console one of the two possible states:

To what extent the pool has filled up and how many percent each pipe has contributed with. All percent values must be formatted to an integer (without rounding).
"The pool is [x]% full. Pipe 1: [y]%. Pipe 2: [z]%."
If the pool has overflown – with how many liters it has overflown for the given time – a floating-point number.
"For [x] hours the pool overflows with [y] liters."
Have in mind that due to the rounding to an integer, there is data loss and it is normal the sum of the percents to be 99%, not 100%.
