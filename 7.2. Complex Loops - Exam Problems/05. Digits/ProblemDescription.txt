Write a program that reads from the console 1 integer within the range [100 … 999], and then prints it a predefined number of times – modifying it before each print, as follows:

If the number is divisible by 5 without reminder, subtract from it its first digit.
If the number is divisible by 3 without reminder, subtract from it its second digit
If none of the above-mentioned conditions is valid, add to it its third digit.
Print on the console N lines, and each line has M numbers, that are result of the above actions.

N = sum of the first and second digit of the number.
M = sum of the first and third digit of the number.
Input Data
The input is read from the console and is an integer within the range [100 … 999].

Output Data
Print on the console all integer numbers, result of the above-mentioned calculations in the respective number of rows and columns as in the examples.

Input	  Output	          Comments
132	    129 126 123
        120 119 121
        123 120 119
        121 123 120	      (1 + 3) = 4 and (1 + 2) = 3 → 4 lines with 3 numbers in each
                          Input number 132 
                          132 → division by 3 → 132 - 3 =
                          = 129 → division by 3 → 129 - 3 = 
                          = 126 → division by 3 → 126 - 3 = 
                          = 123 → division by 3 → 123 - 3 = 
                          = 120 → division by 5 → 120 - 1 = 
                          ..... 121 → neither by 5, nor 3 → 121 + 2 = 123
