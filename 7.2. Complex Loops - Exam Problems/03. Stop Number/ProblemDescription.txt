03. Stop Number 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-7-2-complex-loops-exam-problems/stop-number/stop-number.html

Write a program that prints on the console all numbers from N to M, that are divisible by 2 and 3 without reminder, in reversed order.
We will read one more "stop" number from the console – S.
If any of the numbers divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to the stop number, it should not be printed, and the program should end.
Otherwise print all numbers up to N, that meet the condition.

Input Data
Read from the console 3 numbers, each on a single line:

N – integer number: 0 ≤ N < M.
M – integer number: N < M ≤ 10000.
S – integer number: N ≤ S ≤ M.

Output Data
Print on the console on a single line all numbers, that meet the condition, separated by space.

30
15	    30 24 18 12 6	    Numbers from 30 to 1, that are divisible at the same time by 2 and 3 without reminder are: 30, 24, 18, 12                                 and 6. The number 15 is not equal to any, so the sequence continues.

36
12	    36 30 24 18	      Numbers from 36 to 1, that are divisible at the same time by 2 and 3 without reminder are: 36, 30, 24, 18, 12                             and 6. The number 12 is equal to the stop number, so we stop by 18.
