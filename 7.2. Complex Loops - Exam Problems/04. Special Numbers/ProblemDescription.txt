https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-7-2-complex-loops-exam-problems/special-numbers/special-numbers.html

Write a program that reads one integer number N and generates all possible special numbers from 1111 to 9999. 
To be considered special, a number must correspond to the following condition:

N to be divisible by each of its digits without reminder.
Example: upon N = 16, 2418 is a special number:

16 / 2 = 8 without reminder
16 / 4 = 4 without reminder
16 / 1 = 16 without reminder
16 / 8 = 2 without reminder
Input Data
The input is read from the console and consists of one integer within the range [1 â€¦ 600 000].

Output Data
