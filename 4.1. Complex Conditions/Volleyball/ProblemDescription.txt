during weekdays and plays volleyball only during weekends and on holidays. 
Vladimir plays in Sofia every Saturday, when he is not working, and he is not traveling to his hometown and also during 2/3 of the holidays.
He travels to his hometown h times a year, where he plays volleyball with his old friends on Sunday.
Vladimir is not working 3/4 of the weekends, during which he is in Sofia. 
Furthermore, during leap years Vladimir plays 15% more volleyball than usual.
We accept that the year has exactly 48 weekends, suitable for volleyball.
Write a program that calculates how many times Vladimir has played volleyball through the year. 
Round the result down to the nearest whole number (e.g. 2.15 -> 2; 9.95 -> 9).

The input data is read from the console:

The first line contains the word “leap” (leap year) or “normal” (a normal year with 365 days).
The second line contains the integer p – the count of holidays in the year (which are not Saturday or Sunday).
The third line contains the integer h – the count of weekends, in which Vladimir travels to his hometown.
