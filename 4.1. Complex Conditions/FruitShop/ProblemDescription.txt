A fruit shop during week days sells in the following prices:

Fruit	       Price
banana        2.50
apple         1.20
orange        0.85
grapefruit    1.45
kiwi          2.70
pineapple     5.50
grapes	      3.85

During the weekend days the prices are higher:

Fruit	         Price
banana          2.70
apple           1.25
orange          0.90
grapefruit      1.60
kiwi            3.00
pineapple       5.60
grapes	        4.20


Write a program that reads from the console a fruit (banana / apple / …), a day of the week (Monday / Tuesday / …) and a quantity (a decimal number) and calculates the price according to the prices from the tables above. 
The result has to be printed rounded up to 2 digits after the decimal point. 
Print “error” if it is an invalid day of the week or an invalid name of a fruit.
