A company is giving the following commissions to its traders according to the city, in which they are working and the volume of sales s:

City	    0 <= s <= 500	    500 < s <= 1000	    1000 < s <= 10000	    s > 10000
Sofia         5%                  7%                   8%             12%
Varna         4.5%                7.5%                 10%	          13%   
Plovdiv	      5.5%                8%                   12%	          14.5%

Write a program that reads the name of a city (string) and the volume of sales (decimal number) and calculates the rate of the commission fee. 
The result has to be shown rounded up to 2 digits after the decimal point. 
When there is an invalid city or volume of sales (a negative number), print "error".
