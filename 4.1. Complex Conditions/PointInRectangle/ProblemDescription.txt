03. Point in Rectangle 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-4-1-complex-conditions/complex-logical-conditions/complex-logical-conditions.html

Write a program that checks whether a point {x, y} is placed onto any of the sides of a rectangle {x1, y1} â€“ {x2, y2}. 
The input data is read from the console and consists of 6 lines: the decimal numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, x and y (as it is guaranteed that x1 < x2 and y1 < y2).
Print "Border" (if the point lies on any of the sides) or "Inside / Outside" (in the opposite case).
