https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-5-2-loops-exam-problems/exam-problems/smart-lily/smart-lily.html

Lilly is N years old. For each birthday she receives a present. For each odd birthday (1, 3, 5, …, n) she receives toys, and for each even birthday (2, 4, 6, …, n) she receives money.
For her second birthday she received 10.00 USD, and the amount is increased by 10.00 USD for each following even birthday (2 -> 10, 4 -> 20, 6 -> 30 etc.). Over the years Lilly has secretly saved her money.
Lilly's brother, in the years when she received money, took 1.00 USD from each of the amounts.
Lilly has sold the toys, received over the years, each one for P USD and added the sum to the amount of saved money. 
With the money she wanted to buy a washing machine for X USD.
Write a program that calculates how much money she has saved and if it is enough to buy a washing machine.

Input Data
We read from the console 3 numbers, each on a separate line:

Lilly's age – integer in the range of [1 … 77].
Price of the washing machine – number in the range of [1.00 … 10 000.00].
Unit price of each toy – integer in the range of [0 … 40].

Output Data
Print on the console one single line:

If Lilly's money is enough:
“Yes! {N}” – where N is the remaining money after the purchase
If the money is not enough:
“No! {M}” – where M is the insufficiency amount
Numbers N and M must be formatted up to the second symbol after the decimal point.

                          For the first birthday she gets a toy; 2nd -> 10 USD; 3rd -> toy; 4th -> 10 + 10 = 20 USD; 5th -> toy; 6th ->                           20 + 10 = 30 USD; 7th -> toy; 8th -> 30 + 10 = 40 USD; 9th -> toy; 10th -> 40 + 10 = 50 USD.
                          She has saved: 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150 USD. She sold 5 toys for 6 USD each = 30 USD.
                          Her brother took 1 USD 5 times = 5 USD. Remaining amount: 150 + 30 – 5 = 175 USD.
                          175 >= 170 (price of the washing machine): she managed to buy it and is left with 175-170 = 5 USD.

                          She has saved 550 USD. She has sold 11 toys, 3 USD each = 33 USD. Her brother has taken for 10 years 1 USD                               each year = 10 USD. Remaining amount: 550 + 33 - 10 = 573 USD. 
                          573 < 1570.98: she did not manage to buy a washing machine. The insufficiency amount is: 1570.98 - 573 =                                 997.98 USD.
