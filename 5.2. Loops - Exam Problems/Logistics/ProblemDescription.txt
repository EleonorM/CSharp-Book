You are responsible for the logistics various types of cargo. Depending on the weight of each cargo, you need a different vehicle, and this will cost a different price per ton:

Up to 3 tons – a minibus (200 USD per ton).
From over 3 and up to 11 tons – truck (175 USD per ton).
Over 11 tons – train (120 USD per ton).
Your task is to calculate the average price per ton of the cargo, and also what percentage of the cargo is transported in each vehicle.

Input Data
From the console we must read a sequence of numbers, each on a separate line:

First line: count of cargo for transportation – integer in the range of [1 … 1000].
On the next lines we pass the tonnage of the current cargo – integer in the range of [1 … 1000].
Output Data
Print on the console 4 lines, as follows:

Line #1 – the average price per ton of the cargo (rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point).
Line #2 – percentage of the cargo, carried by minibus (between 0.00% and 100.00%, rounded up to the second digit after the decimal point).
Line #3 – percentage of the cargo, carried by truck (between 0.00% and 100.00%).
Line #4 – percentage of the cargo, carried by train (between 0.00% and 100.00%).

            64.00%	            By minibus you transport two of the cargo 1 + 3, total of 4 tons.
                                By truck you transport one of the cargo: 5 tons.
                                By train you transport one of the cargo: 16 tons.
                                Sum of all cargo is: 1 + 5 + 16 + 3 = 25 tons.
                                Percentage of the cargo by minibus: 4/25*100 = 16.00%
                                Percentage of the cargo by truck: 5/25*100 = 20.00%
                                Percentage of the cargo by train: 16/25*100 = 64.00%
                                Average price per ton of carried cargo: (4 * 200 + 5 * 175 + 16 * 120) / 25 = 143.80
