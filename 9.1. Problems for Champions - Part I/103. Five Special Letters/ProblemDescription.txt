03. Five Special Letters 
https://csharp-book.softuni.org/Content/Chapter-9-1-problems-for-champions/five-special-letters/five-special-letters.html

Two numbers are given: start and end. Write a program that generates all combinations of 5 letters, each among the sets of {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'} so that the weight of these 5 letters is a number in the range [start … end], inclusive. Print them in alphabetical order, in a single row, separated by a space.

The weight of one letter is calculated as follows:

weight('a') = 5;
weight('b') = -12;
weight('c') = 47;
weight('d') = 7;
weight('e') = -32;
The weight of the sequence of the letters c1, c2, …, cn is calculated by removing all the letters that are repeated (from right to left) and then calculating the formula:

weight(c1c2…cn) = 1 * weight(c1) + 2 * weight(c2) + … + n * weight(cn)
For example, the weight of bcddc is calculated as follows:

First, we remove the repeating letters and get bcd. Then we apply the formula: 1 * weight('b') + 2 * weight('c') + 3 * weight('d') = 1 * (-12) + 2 * 47 + 3 * 7 = 103.

Another example: weight("cadae") = weight("cade") = 1 * 47 + 2 * 5 + 3 * 7 + 4 * (-32) = -50.

Input Data
The input data is read from the console. It consists of two numbers:

The number for start.
The number for end.
Input data will always be valid and will always be in the format described. No need to check.

Output Data
The result should be printed on the console as a sequence of strings, arranged in alphabetical order. Each string must be separated from the next one by a single space. If the weight of any of the 5 letter strings does not exist within the specified range, print "No".

Constraints
Numbers for start and end are integers in the range [-10000 … 10000].
Allowed program time: 0.25 seconds.
Allowed memory: 16 MB.
