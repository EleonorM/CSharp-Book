We all know the game called "Bulls and Cows" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows). 
Upon having a particular 4-digit secret number and a 4-digit suggested number, the following rules are applied:

If a digit in the suggested number matches a digit in the secret number and is located at the same position, we have a bull.
If a digit in the suggested number matches a digit in the secret number, but is located at a different position, we have a cow.
Secret number	1	4	8	1	Comment
Suggested number	8	8	1	1	Bulls = 1
Cows = 2
Secret number	2	2	4	1	Comment
Suggested number	9	9	2	4	Bulls = 0
Cows = 2
Upon having a particular secret number and the bulls and cows pertaining to it, our task is to find all possible suggested numbers in ascending order.

If there are no suggested numbers that match the criteria provided from the console, we must print "No".

The input data will always be valid. There is no need to verify them.

Output Data
The output data must be printed on the console. The output must consist of a single line, holding all suggested numbers, space separated. If there are no suggested numbers that match the criteria provided from the console, we must print “No”.
